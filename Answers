The microservices can be deployed to AWS ECS.
A sample IaC configuration for the main ECS cluster is in file ecs.tf
buildspec.yml file also includes configuration to build and push docker-compose file.

Amazon ECS is a fully managed container orchestration service. 
It is a secure, scalable, reliable and cost-optimised service which can be integrated with many other AWS services. 

We create task definitions for each of the service-1 and service-2 using their docker images,
crete our service, and assing the tasks to the service and an ALB.  

The ALB should be set up, and configure routes through target groups to the proper microservices based on the received API Paths.

2. With AWS CodePipeline, we can integrate a complete CI/CD pipeline, that will build code, run tests, and deploy the new code continuously.
On push events from the versioning repository, we run the new build and tests and update the docker image in ECR. 

To avoid downtime, we can use rolling updates with teh ECS clusters. 
When a new service is started after a deplyment, the Amazon ECS service scheduler replaces the current running tasts with the new tasks.
Using this, there'll alwasy be a new service running, before taking down the current running task based on minumum and maximum configurations.
